# TTRPG Map Making App - Project Planning Document

## Project Overview
A browser-based map making application designed specifically for TTRPG (Tabletop Role-Playing Game) groups. The app will provide an intuitive interface for creating, editing, and sharing maps for tabletop gaming sessions.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Canvas-based map editor
   - Drawing tools for basic shapes and terrain features
   - Layer system for organizing map elements
   - Grid overlay system (square/hex) with customizable size
   - Basic terrain tools (walls, doors, furniture)

2. User Interface
   - Toolbar with drawing tools
   - Layer management panel
   - Property panel for selected elements
   - Zoom and pan controls
   - Minimap for navigation

3. Map Management
   - Save/load maps locally
   - Export maps as images
   - Basic undo/redo functionality

### Technical Requirements
1. Browser Compatibility
   - Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes

2. Performance
   - Smooth drawing experience
   - Efficient canvas rendering
   - Responsive UI interactions

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- HTML5 Canvas for map rendering
- React.js for UI components
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Canvas libraries (Fabric.js or Konva.js) for advanced canvas manipulation

### Data Management
- Local storage for saving maps
- File system integration for import/export
- State management with React Context or Redux

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Canvas Setup
- Basic project setup with React and TypeScript
- Canvas implementation with basic drawing capabilities
- Grid system implementation
- Basic UI layout

### Phase 2: Drawing Tools
- Implementation of basic shape tools
- Terrain drawing tools
- Layer management system
- Property editing for map elements

### Phase 3: Map Management
- Save/load functionality
- Export capabilities
- Undo/redo system
- Performance optimizations

### Phase 4: UI Polish
- Responsive design implementation
- UI/UX improvements
- Tool tooltips and help system
- Final testing and bug fixes

## Development Approach
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Component-based architecture
- Continuous testing during development
- Regular performance monitoring

## Success Criteria
1. Users can create basic maps within 5 minutes
2. Smooth drawing experience with no noticeable lag
3. Maps can be saved and loaded reliably
4. UI is intuitive and requires minimal learning

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 2: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 3: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 4: 1 week

Total estimated time: 5-8 weeks

## Risk Assessment
1. Performance challenges with large maps
2. Browser compatibility issues
3. Canvas manipulation complexity
4. File handling limitations in browsers

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Create initial project structure
3. Implement basic canvas functionality
4. Begin UI component development
