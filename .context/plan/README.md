# AI Conductor - Multi-Agent Workflow

This project uses an **AI Conductor** to orchestrate expert AI agents in a structured planning process.

## ðŸ“Œ Workflow & Reference Materials
- **[AI Conductor Configuration](ai_conductor.json)** (Defines orchestration logic)
- **[Workflow Diagram](workflow.mmd)** (Visualizes AI Conductor's process)
- **[Agent Interactions](agents.mmd)** (Defines specialized AI roles)
- **[Feedback Handling](feedback.mmd)** (Decision flow for project refinement)
- **[Planning Document Lifecycle](document_states.mmd)** (Tracks state changes)

The AI Code Assistant can reference these files to assist in **workflow optimization, architecture decisions, and project planning**.
