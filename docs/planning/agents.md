# Specialized Planning Agents

The Aegis framework uses specialized AI agents to enhance project planning and development. This document explains how agents are defined, managed, and integrated with the framework's memory system.

## Overview

The agent system consists of several key components:

1. **Agent Types**
   - Each agent has specific expertise and responsibilities
   - Agents work together under AI Conductor orchestration
   - Clear role definitions guide agent behavior
   - Memory access controls maintain system integrity

2. **Memory Integration**
   - Agents interact with specific memory types
   - Access controls define read/write permissions
   - Context sharing enables collaboration
   - State tracking maintains consistency

3. **Workflow Management**
   - AI Conductor coordinates agent activities
   - Clear communication patterns guide interaction
   - Task assignment follows project needs
   - Feedback loops ensure quality

4. **Validation System**
   - Role validation ensures proper expertise
   - Access validation maintains security
   - Output validation ensures quality
   - State validation maintains consistency
