# Planning System

The Aegis framework implements a sophisticated planning system that integrates with different types of memory to create, validate, and maintain project plans. This document explains how the planning system works and how it integrates with the framework's operation patterns.

## Overview

The planning system consists of several integrated components:

1. **Core Components**
   - AI Conductor orchestrates the planning process
   - Specialized agents provide domain expertise
   - Workflow engine manages state transitions
   - Feedback system enables iterative refinement

2. **Memory Integration**
   - Semantic Memory stores architectural decisions and patterns
   - Procedural Memory tracks planning steps and workflows
   - Working Memory maintains current planning focus
   - Episodic Memory records planning sessions and feedback

3. **Document Management**
   - Planning documents capture project structure
   - Decision records track architectural choices
   - Workflow documents guide implementation
   - Feedback records track improvements

4. **Validation System**
   - Format rules ensure consistent structure
   - Content rules verify completeness
   - Reference rules maintain connections
   - State rules manage transitions

## Planning Process

### 1. Initialization
```yaml
planning_init:
  steps:
    - validate_framework: {check: true}
    - load_context: {if_exists: true}
    - initialize_agents: {required: true}
    - set_focus: {from: context}
```

### 2. Document Creation
```yaml
document_creation:
  required:
    - project_overview: {complete: true}
    - goals: {defined: true}
    - architecture: {validated: true}
    - timeline: {realistic: true}
  
  validation:
    - format: {check: true}
    - content: {complete: true}
    - references: {resolve: true}
```

### 3. State Management
```yaml
planning_states:
  transitions:
    init:
      to: [active]
      validate: [context, agents]
    
    active:
      to: [review, hold]
      validate: [progress, blockers]
    
    review:
      to: [active, complete]
      validate: [feedback, changes]
    
    complete:
      final: true
      validate: [deliverables]
```

### 4. Document Management
```yaml
document_states:
  drafting:
    status: initial
    next: [review]
  
  review:
    status: in_progress
    next: [refinement, drafting]
  
  refinement:
    status: updating
    next: [review, approval]
  
  approval:
    status: final
    next: []
```

```yaml
feedback_flow:
  sources:
    - user_input: {priority: high}
    - agent_review: {priority: medium}
    - system_checks: {priority: low}
  
  processing:
    - collect: {all: true}
    - analyze: {impact: true}
    - prioritize: {by: importance}
    - integrate: {into: plan}
```

### 6. Error Handling
```yaml
planning_errors:
  invalid_state:
    msg: "Invalid planning state"
    action: show_valid_states
    help: "Check state transition rules"
  
  incomplete_plan:
    msg: "Planning document incomplete"
    action: show_missing
    help: "Complete required sections"
  
  validation_failed:
    msg: "Plan validation failed"
    action: show_issues
    help: "Address validation errors"
```
