# AI Planning System

The Aegis framework implements a sophisticated multi-agent planning system orchestrated by an AI Conductor. This system facilitates collaborative problem-solving and project planning through specialized AI agents.

## Documentation Structure

1. [Overview](overview.md)
   - System architecture
   - Key components
   - Core concepts

2. [AI Conductor](conductor.md)
   - Role and responsibilities
   - Orchestration logic
   - Process management

3. [Specialized Agents](agents.md)
   - Agent roles
   - Responsibilities
   - Interactions

4. [Workflow](workflow.md)
   - Planning process
   - State transitions
   - Document lifecycle

5. [Feedback System](feedback.md)
   - Feedback handling
   - Iteration process
   - Refinement workflow

## Quick Start

1. Initiate planning with `/aide plan`
2. Follow the AI Conductor's guidance
3. Provide feedback when requested
4. Review and approve the final plan

## Key Features

1. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**
   - Specialized expert agents
   - Coordinated problem-solving
   - Comprehensive coverage

2. **Structured Workflow**
   - Clear process steps
   - State management
   - Progress tracking

3. **Feedback Integration**
   - Iterative refinement
   - User alignment
   - Continuous improvement

4. **Document Management**
   - State tracking
   - Version control
   - Final deliverables

## Integration Points

1. **Commands**
   - `/aide plan`: Start planning process
   - `/aide save`: Save planning state
   - `/aide status`: Check planning progress

2. **Memory System**
   - Procedural memory for workflows
   - Semantic memory for decisions
   - Working memory for active planning

3. **Documentation**
   - Planning documents
   - Architecture decisions
   - Implementation guides
