## Key Components

### 1. AI Conductor
- Orchestrates the planning process
- Manages specialized agents
- Guides workflow progression
- Handles document states

### 2. Specialized Agents
- Product Manager: Scope definition
- Tech Lead: Architecture planning
- UX Designer: Interface design
- QA Specialist: Quality assurance
- DevOps Engineer: Infrastructure planning

### 3. Workflow Engine
1. User Alignment
   - Gather requirements
   - Understand constraints
   - Set objectives

2. Team Creation
   - Select agents
   - Assign roles
   - Define responsibilities

3. Problem Solving
   - Analyze requirements
   - Design architecture
   - Plan implementation

4. Refinement
   - Process feedback
   - Adjust plans
   - Improve solutions

5. Finalization
   - Complete documentation
   - Verify requirements
   - Obtain approval

### 4. Document Manager
- Tracks document states
- Manages versions
- Coordinates reviews
- Handles approvals

### 5. Feedback System
- Collects user input
- Coordinates reviews
- Manages iterations
- Updates plans

## Core Concepts

### 1. Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Specialized expertise
- Coordinated effort
- Comprehensive coverage
- Balanced perspectives

### 2. Structured Planning
- Clear process
- Defined states
- Tracked progress
- Managed iterations

### 3. User-Centric Design
