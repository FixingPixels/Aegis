# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

The Aegis framework uses a structured decision-recording system to maintain a clear history of architectural and technical decisions. This document explains how decisions are managed, validated, and integrated with the framework's operation patterns.

## Overview

Architectural decisions in Aegis are organized into several key aspects:

1. **Core Components**
   - Metadata tracks basic information like ID, timestamps, and status
   - Content captures the actual decision details and rationale
   - Validation ensures decisions are properly formatted and referenced
   - Integration connects decisions with other framework components

2. **Decision Lifecycle**
   - Decisions start as 'proposed' when new changes are being considered
   - Move to 'accepted' when approved and implemented
   - Can be marked as 'deprecated' when no longer recommended
   - Finally become 'superseded' when replaced by newer decisions

3. **Memory Integration**
   - Stored in semantic memory as project knowledge
   - Referenced by tasks during implementation
   - Tracked in sessions as they're made
   - Maintained in current state for context

4. **Documentation Flow**
   - Clear context explains why the decision is needed
   - Specific decision details what is being done
   - Rationale documents why this approach was chosen
   - Impact assessment shows effects and required changes
   - Validation ensures proper implementation

This structure helps:
- Track important project decisions
- Understand why changes were made
- Follow the evolution of the system
- Maintain consistent architecture
- Guide future decisions

## Validation Rules

### 1. Format Validation
```yaml
validation:
  format:
    id: "DECISION-\\d{3}"
    status: ["proposed", "accepted", "deprecated", "superseded"]
    memory_types: ["semantic", "episodic"]
    priority: ["high", "medium", "low"]
  
  content:
    required: [context, decision, rationale, impact, validation]
    optional: [notes, references]
    validate: [completeness, clarity]
  
  references:
    validate: true
    circular: false
    required: true
```

### 2. State Validation
```yaml
state_validation:
  transitions:
    proposed:
      to: [accepted, deprecated]
      validate: [references, impacts]
    
    accepted:
      to: [deprecated, superseded]
      validate: [replacement, migration]
    
    deprecated:
      to: [superseded]
      validate: [replacement]
    
    superseded:
      final: true
      validate: [replacement_exists]
```

### 3. Reference Validation
```yaml
reference_validation:
  types:
    decisions: "DECISION-\\d{3}"
    tasks: "\\d{6}_\\d{4}_[a-z_]+"
    sessions: "\\d{8}_\\d{4}_session"
  
  rules:
    - target_exists: true
    - valid_format: true
    - no_cycles: true
```

## Error Handling

### 1. Format Errors
```yaml
format_errors:
  invalid_id:
    msg: "Invalid decision ID format"
    action: show_format
    help: "Use DECISION-XXX format"
  
  invalid_status:
    msg: "Invalid decision status"
    action: show_valid_states
    help: "Use valid status values"
  
  invalid_types:
    msg: "Invalid memory types"
    action: show_valid_types
    help: "Use semantic and episodic"
```

### 2. State Errors
```yaml
state_errors:
  invalid_transition:
    msg: "Invalid state transition"
    action: show_valid_transitions
    help: "Check state transition rules"
  
  missing_validation:
    msg: "Missing state validation"
    action: show_requirements
    help: "Complete validation requirements"
```

### 3. Reference Errors
```yaml
reference_errors:
  invalid_target:
    msg: "Invalid reference target"
    action: show_target
    help: "Verify reference exists"
  
  circular_reference:
    msg: "Circular reference detected"
    action: show_cycle
    help: "Break reference cycle"
```

## Operation Pattern Integration

### 1. Framework Check Pattern
```yaml
framework_check:
  decisions:
    validate:
      - format: {check: true}
      - status: {valid: true}
      - references: {resolve: true}
```

### 2. Memory Processing Pattern
```yaml
memory_processing:
  decisions:
    types: [semantic, episodic]
    load: [content, references]
    validate: [format, state]
```

### 3. State Management Pattern
```yaml
state_management:
  decisions:
    track:
      - changes: {record: true}
      - transitions: {validate: true}
      - history: {maintain: true}
```
