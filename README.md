**Aegis** is an advanced AI-assisted development framework designed to guide, protect, and orchestrate your projects with structured memory management and multi-agent planning. Aegis ensures your AI assistant stays informed and effective throughout the development lifecycle.

Inspired by the way the human brain organizes knowledge, Aegis leverages:

Semantic Memory for long-term knowledge retention
Episodic Memory to track project history
Procedural Memory for task execution
Working Memory for current focus and active problem-solving
At its core, the AI Conductor intelligently coordinates specialized agents for planning, execution, and optimization. Aegis also maintains clarity and continuity through a lightweight .context directory, keeping your project structured and accessible at all times.
